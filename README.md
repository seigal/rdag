## rdag_mle
python code to generate RDAGs [1, Definition 2.1], to sample from their distribution, and to compute MLEs

## rdag_mle_figures
code to generate the figures in [1]. contains the function "mle_compare", which compares the RDAG MLE with its corresponding uncoloured DAG MLE. 

the algorithm used to compute the RDAG MLE is [1, Algorithm 1].
